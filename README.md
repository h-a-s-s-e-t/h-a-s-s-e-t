- 👋 Hi, I’m @h-a-s-s-e-t
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, graphic design, art and music. But don't get me wrong I'm not a singer I just love music, it helps me get things done faster and easier. :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning responsive web design, which I'm almost done with. After finishing this I plan to learn javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to web design using html and css.
